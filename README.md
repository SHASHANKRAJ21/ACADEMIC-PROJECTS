Thank you for visiting my Academic Projects Portfolio! This repository contains a curated collection of projects that I've worked on throughout my studies in Computer Science and Engineering.

You'll find a variety of projects here, some developed individually and others as part of group collaborations. These projects showcase my skills in programming languages like C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on core concepts such as Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Feel free to explore the projects, and if you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out
